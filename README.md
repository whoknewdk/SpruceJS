SpruceJS
========
SpruceJS is a server-side module assembling framework for ASP.NET. Is is very usefull for single page applications where a "target" JavaScript file is desired and viewed more like an assembly than an individual script file.

SpruceJS works on source files by automatically assembling these every time you refresh your browser during development.

Features
========
* Module centric JavaScript development.
* Super fast run-time assembling during development. No build! No application running in the background!
* Debugging via sourcemaps
* Native Dependency Injection
* < 1 KB JavaScript library required (you can even roll your own).

Benefits
========
* Control your requests! 150 requests are never a good idea, not even during development.
* Never worry about what order your scripts are loaded.
* Clearly distinguish between "source files" and what is loaded by the browser.
* Declare module using "names" and easily referenced accordingly.
* Run fully assembled, minified & gzip'ed JavaScript both during development and in production.
* Decouple your modules from the source files they reside in.
