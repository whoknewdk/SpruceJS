SpruceJS
========

SpruceJS is a server-side AMD-style module assembling framework for ASP.NET. It works great for single page applications where a single (or more) "target" JavaScript files are desired and these are viewed more like assemblies than individual script files.

SpruceJS works on source files by automatically assembling these every time you refresh your browser during development.

Features
========
* Module centric JavaScript development.
* Scaleble enterprise application architechture.
* Super fast run-time assembling during development. No build! No application running in the background!
* Debugging via sourcemaps
* Native Dependency Injection
* < 1 KB JavaScript library required (you can even roll your own).
* 

Benifits
========
* Control your requests! 150 requests are never a good idea, not even during development.
* Never worry about what order your scripts are loaded.
* Clearly distinguish between "source files" and what is loaded by the browser.
* Modules are declated using "names" and easily referenced accordingly.
* Run fully assembled, minified & gzip'ed JavaScript both during development and in production.
* Decoupled your modules from the source files they reside in.
