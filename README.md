SpruceJS
========

SpruceJS is a .NET framework for building Enterprise application architechture using AMD style modules
for scope & dependency management.

SpruceJS works on source files automatically building a single JavaScript file every time your refresh your browser 
in development.

During the publishing process SpruceJS will build a static file completely eliminating the build process present 
during development.

* Dependencies are handled server-side.
* Debugging via source maps.
* Native dependency injection.
* Native minification.
* Native gzipping
